# Hearts Tracker
An iOS app for tracking a game of Hearts

## To Do
- Display rounds and points
- Review comments from other apps
- Press to edit user/names
- Quick delete user name
- Add game score limit (show game over when final score is reached, allow to keep playing?)
- Rest game options
    ✅ Reset
    ✅ Reset names and scores
    - Reset system defaults (put in settings instead?)
✅ Track points per round, strict checks (only advance when moon shot or 26 points totaled)
✅ Persist game state ICO crash/restart (switch from "savePlayerNames" to always persisting data)
- How to handle if someone is assigned 26 points?
    - Convert 26 points to a shoot the moon instead?
    - Ask the user what they'd like to do?
    - Prevent adding 26 points to a single user?

## Ideas
✅ When editing (adjusting scores) swap moon button for "reset" button to quickly get back to 0
